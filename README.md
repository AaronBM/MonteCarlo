# MonteCarlo Simulation


Goals
Include basic examples of Drunkard's Walk in Python, C, and possibly Fortran.

Find metrics of:
longest walk 
shortest walk
average walk

Reevaluate the same metrics with:
a different starting point
a partial bias towards one direction 


Code Evaluation to include:
runtime analysis 
memory managment, computational efficiency, and Kool graphics
